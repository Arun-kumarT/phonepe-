#Problem Statement
    *1. Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
    clone it..
    *2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
    and pre-processing steps.
    *3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
    retrieval.
    *4. Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
    to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
    *5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
    *6. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different
    facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

#Approach
    #1.Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the
    Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in JSON file.
    #2.Data transformation: Use  Python, along with libraries such as Pandas,
    to manipulate and pre-process the data.
    #3.Database insertion:Use the SQL Alchemy in Python to
    connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQl commands.
    #4.Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create
    an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map
    functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used
    to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to
    select different facts and figures to display.
    #5.Data retrieval: Use the SQL Alchemy library to connect to the
    MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in
    the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
